We predicted the QSO counts that can be detected by the LSST survey using rubin_sim/maf (https://github.com/lsst/rubin_sim), using the simulated data from the Rubin Observatory.

1: All analyses were completed on SciServer (https://www.sciserver.org/), setting up the environment according to the steps described in [LSST_OpSim](https://github.com/RichardsGroup/LSST_OpSim).

2: We used new tables (https://github.com/guodongli2024/create_NQSO_tables) generated from the QLF provided by Shen et al. (2020) to calculate the number of QSOs.

Here, we provide several notebooks that describe the structure of the simulated data and how to implement the desired functionalities based on the data: survey depth, QSO number distribution over time, redshift, and variations across different regions. Each folder corresponds to one figure in our manuscript.
